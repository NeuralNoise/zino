API:
    PUSH:
        To push N jobs, send:

        PUSH
        job1_id job1_type job1_priority
        job2_id job2_type job2_priority
        ....
        jobN_id jobN_type jobN_priority

        Server will reply with:
        PUSHED N
    
    POP:
        To pop N jobs, send:

        POP
        N

        Server will reply with:

        POPPED
        job1_id job1_type job1_date job1_priority
        job2_id job2_type job2_date job2_priority
        ....
        jobN_id jobN_type jobN_date jobN_priority

        Then client should keep the connection open.
        When N jobs are done:

        DONE
        job1_id
        job2_id
        job3_id
        ....
        jobN_id

        if a certain job is popped but not done, it will be immediately re-pushed


Asymptotic Complexity:
    
    N is the number of jobs and M the maximum priority

    Memory: O( M^2 )

    Time:
    Pop: O( M )
    Push: O( M )

    Space: O( N )
